	1.	Ensuring Data Integrity: Addressed legacy data outages and ensured reliable, accurate data flow.
	2.	Supporting Key Migrations: Successfully handled the T+1 settlement migration, mitigating risks and ensuring smooth operations.
	3.	Compliance in Deployments: Adhered to security and compliance standards during projects like the Aurora to AQ host migration.
